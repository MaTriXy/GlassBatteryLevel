Overview
========
So many times I find that I want to know what the battery level is on [Google Glass](http://www.google.com/glass/start/) hands-free so I made this app.

In order to compile and install this app please refer to the [GDK Quick Start](https://developers.google.com/glass/develop/gdk/quick-start). Don't want to compile, grab the [GlassBatteryLevel.apk](https://github.com/alexdennis/GlassBatteryLevel/raw/master/bin/GlassBatteryLevel.apk) and side load it yourself. 

This is an extremely simple application but it works. I found myself saying "Ok Glass, battery level" so much that it just made sense go ahead and make it work. Any suggestions or pull requests are welcome.
